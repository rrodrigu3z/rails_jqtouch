rails_jqtouch
=============

A Ruby on Rails plugin to wrap some of the functionality of the jQuery plugin jQTouch, very useful
for creating web applications for Mobile Webkit browsers (like iPhone).

I created this plugin to make some examples of web applications development for the iPhone 
(using Rails of course) at FLISOL 2009 - Punto Fijo (scheduled at May 9 in Punto Fijo, Venezuela). 

jQTouch is very new and cool, and I think a Rails plugin can help to improve jQTouch and, of course,
make the web development for mobile devices easier in Rails. Functionality still incomplete, I'm not
a "mobile device power developer" so, comments, sugestions and improvements are welcome. Some ideas
were taked from rails_iui by Noel Rappin.

And... this is my first public released code, so... be nice!!!

Example
=======

After install rails_jqtouch (see clone url), you must run a rake task to copy all needed files
to de rails project (javascripts, stylesheets, images and layouts). 

rake rails_jqtouch:install

There are another couple of rake tasks available:

rake rails_jqtouch:jqtouch_version  # Show jQTouch version included
rake rails_jqtouch:clean            # Delete all installed files

Similiar to rails_iui, rails_jqtouch can recognize Mobile Safari Web Browsers, so, include the
following line to any controller or ApplicationController:

acts_as_iphone_controller

This enable your controller to respond_to an :iphone option, and looking xxxx.iphone.erb templates.

Helpers methods from Jqtouch::MobileHelper are included automatically.

A simple application.iphone.erb layout is generated and copied to app/views/layouts, use this as
an example or reference for your custom layouts.

Doc
===

Documentation is included in all files, but... in Spanish!!, so if someone could translate that...
help is welcome.

My English is not very good.


Enjoy!!
